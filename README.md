# Monty Hall Problem Simulation and Interactive Game

This Python project implements a simulation and interactive version of the classic **Monty Hall problem**.  
Users can either run a large-scale simulation to observe probabilities or play the game interactively via the console.

## Features

- **Statistical simulation**: Runs thousands of trials to show winning probabilities when switching or staying with the initial choice.  
- **Interactive game**: Play Monty Hall in the console, choose doors, decide whether to switch, and see your results.  
- Tracks and displays win/loss statistics during interactive play.
